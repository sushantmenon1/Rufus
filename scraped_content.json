AI is powerful but also complex, and it\u2019s easy to get lost in its excitement. The real challenge is not in understanding the technology but in applying it to solve a problem that matters. The key is to start with the problem, not the technology. The first step in starting an AI business is identifying a problem worth solving. This might sound straightforward, but it\u2019s actually where many AI startups go wrong. The temptation is to start with the AI technology you\u2019re excited about and then look for a problem that fits it. But that\u2019s backwards. You need to start with the problem first. Why? Because businesses succeed by solving problems that people care about. If you start with the technology, you run the risk of building something that no one needs. The best problems to solve are those that are painful and immediate\u2014problems that people are eager to pay to have solved right now. So how do you find these problems? One way is to look for things people are already doing manually that could be automated. AI is particularly good at taking over repetitive tasks that humans aren\u2019t well-suited for. If you can find a task that\u2019s time-consuming, tedious, and done frequently, you\u2019ve likely found a good candidate for automation. Another approach is to look at industries that generate a lot of data. AI thrives on data. If you can identify a way to take that data and turn it into something actionable and valuable, you\u2019re well on your way to building a successful business. For example, in healthcare, an overwhelming amount of data is generated daily, from patient records to medical imaging. An AI that can use this data to identify patterns and provide insights could be incredibly valuable. Once you\u2019ve identified a problem, the next step is building a solution. This is where many AI startups stumble, and it\u2019s usually because they try to do too much too soon. AI is powerful, but it\u2019s not magic. The best approach is to start small\u2014build something simple that works, rather than something complex that doesn\u2019t. The key here is to focus on creating a minimum viable product (MVP) . An MVP is the simplest version of your product that solves the problem you\u2019ve identified. It doesn\u2019t need to be perfect; it just needs to work well enough to start gathering feedback from users. The goal of an MVP is to get your product in front of users as quickly as possible. The sooner you start getting real-world feedback, the sooner you can begin iterating and improving. One thing to keep in mind is that your MVP doesn\u2019t have to be fully automated. In fact, it\u2019s often a good idea to use a \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d approach, where you manually handle parts of the process that your AI isn\u2019t ready to tackle yet. This allows you to test your idea without having to build the entire system up front. It also lets you learn more about the problem and refine your approach as you go. As you build your solution, it\u2019s important to stay focused on the problem you\u2019re solving. It\u2019s easy to get sidetracked by interesting technical challenges or to fall into the trap of adding features that aren\u2019t really necessary. But remember, your goal is to solve the problem in the simplest and most effective way possible. If you do that, everything else will follow. Assembling the Right Team You can\u2019t build an AI business alone. You need a team, and not just any team\u2014a great team. The best teams have a mix of skills: someone who deeply understands the problem domain, someone who can build the technology, and someone who can sell it. If you\u2019re missing any of these, your chances of success drop significantly. When you\u2019re assembling your team, look for people who are problem solvers. AI is still a rapidly evolving field, and things are constantly changing. You need people who can adapt, learn quickly, and think creatively. It\u2019s also crucial to find people who are passionate about what they\u2019re doing. Startups are hard work, and you won\u2019t make it if your team isn\u2019t fully committed. Another important factor is trust. Startups are intense, and there will be times when things go wrong. You need to be able to rely on your team members and know that they\u2019re as committed to the business as you are. This trust is often built by working together on smaller projects before you dive into a startup. Even with a great team and a solid MVP, your AI startup won\u2019t succeed if you don\u2019t manage your resources wisely. This is where a lot of startups fail. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement of building something new and burn through your resources too quickly. But if you run out of money before your product is generating revenue, it\u2019s game over. The key to managing resources is being frugal and focused. Don\u2019t spend money on things you don\u2019t absolutely need. This doesn\u2019t mean you should cut corners, but you should be ruthless about prioritizing. Spend your money where it will have the most impact\u2014on things that will help you build your product, reach customers, or generate revenue. Time is another crucial resource, and it\u2019s often the most valuable one. Time is the one thing you can\u2019t get more of, so you need to use it wisely. Prioritize tasks that will move you closer to your goal and cut out distractions. If something isn\u2019t directly contributing to your progress, it\u2019s probably not worth your time. A common mistake is to spend too much time on things that feel productive but aren\u2019t actually moving the needle\u2014like attending too many meetings, obsessing over minor details, or chasing after investors too early. It\u2019s easy to fall into these traps, especially when you\u2019re trying to build something new. But the most successful startups are the ones that stay laser-focused on their core mission. Once you\u2019ve built a product that solves a real problem and started getting some traction, the next challenge is scaling the business. This is where things get even more difficult. Scaling isn\u2019t just about growing your customer base; it\u2019s about making sure your product, team, and processes can handle that growth. One of the biggest challenges in scaling an AI business is managing the complexity that comes with growth. As you add more customers, data, and features, everything gets more complicated. You need to manage this complexity without losing sight of the problem you\u2019re solving. Scaling also requires building out the business side of your company. That means developing a go-to-market strategy, building a sales team, and finding ways to generate consistent revenue . It also means thinking about things like customer support, legal issues, and operations\u2014things that might not have been as important in the early days but become critical as you grow. Another key to scaling is maintaining your company culture. As your team grows, keeping everyone aligned and motivated becomes harder. You need to be intentional about building a culture that supports your goals and attracts the kind of people you want to work with. Conclusion: The Path Forward Starting an AI business is not easy, but it\u2019s not impossible either. The key is to stay focused on the fundamentals: solve a real problem, build a product people want, assemble a strong team, and manage your resources wisely. You\u2019ll have a solid foundation to build on if you can do that. But remember, success doesn\u2019t happen overnight. It takes time, persistence, and a willingness to adapt. The landscape of AI is constantly evolving, and the challenges you face today might not be the same ones you face tomorrow. But if you keep your eyes on the problem you\u2019re solving and stay committed to your vision, you\u2019ll be in a strong position to succeed. Assembling the Right Team Conclusion: The Path Forward"

        "content": "Top 5 AI Sales Enablement Strategies for SMBs | Linkt Enhance insights with image and video analysis Tailor experiences with personalized suggestions Streamline creativity with text prompts Enhance insights with image and video analysis Tailor experiences with personalized suggestions Streamline creativity with text prompts Top 5 AI Sales Enablement Strategies for SMBs 2. Chatbots for Customer Interaction 3. Personalized Email Campaigns Putting It All Together Most people think AI is just for big companies. It\u2019s not. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) can use AI, too, with the help of AI software development companies. It can help you sell more without hiring more people. The power of AI isn\u2019t just in its ability to crunch numbers; it\u2019s in its ability to transform how you approach sales and customer engagement. Here\u2019s how SMBs can leverage AI effectively: If you\u2019ve got a bunch of leads, how do you know which ones are good? AI can help. Lead scoring with AI involves using algorithms to evaluate the potential of each lead to convert into a paying customer. It looks at your leads and tells you which ones will likely buy. Traditional lead-scoring methods rely on basic criteria such as job title, company size, and industry. AI, on the other hand, can analyze a vast array of data points, including behavioral data like website interactions, email engagement, and social media activity. It uses this data to assign a score to each lead, indicating their likelihood to convert. Implementing AI development for lead scoring can significantly improve your sales efficiency. Your sales team will spend more time on high-potential leads and less on those unlikely to convert. This boosts conversion rates and ensures more productive sales efforts, especially since 91% of CMOs admit they must continually innovate to stay competitive 2. Chatbots for Customer Interaction Customers expect quick responses. If you can\u2019t provide that, they might go elsewhere. AI chatbots can answer questions 24/7. They\u2019re not just for big companies. Even a small business can set up a chatbot to handle common queries. This keeps customers happy and saves your team time. AI chatbots have evolved beyond simple scripted responses. Modern chatbots, developed by leading AI solutions companies, can understand natural language and provide personalized responses. They can help with various tasks, from answering FAQs to guiding customers through the purchasing process. For example, if a customer visits your website and has a question about a product, an AI chatbot can instantly provide the information they need. If the question is more complex, the chatbot can seamlessly hand off the conversation to a human representative. This ensures that customers always get their help without long wait times. Furthermore, AI chatbots can gather valuable data about customer preferences and behavior. This data can be used to improve your products and services, tailor marketing campaigns, and enhance overall customer experience. 3. Personalized Email Campaigns Generic emails don\u2019t work. People ignore them. AI can help you send personalized emails that get opened and read. It looks at customer behavior and tailors emails to their interests. This makes your emails more effective and increases sales. AI can analyze data from various sources, such as past purchase history, browsing behavior, and demographic information, to create highly targeted email campaigns. Instead of sending the same email to everyone, AI allows you to send personalized messages that resonate with each recipient. For instance, if a customer frequently purchases running gear, AI can identify this trend and send them emails featuring the latest running shoes, accessories, and related content. In fact, 80% of consumers are more inclined to purchase from brands that personalize their messaging. AI can also optimize email timing. It can determine the best times to send emails based on when each recipient will most likely open them. This ensures that your emails reach customers when they\u2019re most receptive, further boosting engagement rates. Personalized email campaigns drive sales and build stronger customer relationships. Customers appreciate it when businesses understand their preferences and cater to their needs, making them more likely to remain loyal. Guessing is not a strategy. AI can analyze your sales data and predict future sales. It helps you make better decisions about inventory, marketing, and staffing. It\u2019s like having a pretty accurate crystal ball. Sales forecasting with AI involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze historical sales data, market trends, and other relevant factors.

AI can also help you allocate your marketing budget more efficiently. By predicting which products or services will be in high demand, you can focus your marketing efforts on promoting those items. That way, you spend your marketing dollars where they will have the most significant impact. Moreover, sales forecasting can help you manage your workforce more effectively. If you know when to expect a surge in demand, you can ensure you have enough staff on hand to handle the increased workload. That means you can maintain high levels of customer service even during busy periods. AI can figure out what content your customers want to see. Whether it\u2019s blog posts, videos, or product recommendations, AI can analyze data to suggest what will engage your audience. It keeps customers on your site longer and makes them more likely to buy. Content recommendation engines use algorithms to analyze user behavior and preferences. They then use this data to suggest relevant content to each user. If a customer has been browsing winter jackets on your website, the recommendation engine can suggest related items such as hats, gloves, and scarves. This personalization enhances the customer experience and increases the chances of cross-selling and upselling. You can also use AI-powered content recommendations to personalize your website\u2019s content. Each visitor will see a customized version of your site that highlights the products and content most relevant to them. This approach to content delivery creates a more engaging and personalized shopping experience. When customers consistently find valuable and relevant content on your site, they\u2019re more likely to return. This builds brand loyalty and increases each customer\u2019s lifetime value. Putting It All Together These AI strategies don\u2019t require a huge budget or a team of data scientists. Many AI tools are affordable and easy to use. Start small, see what works, and scale up from there. The future of AI is accessible to more than just the big players. SMBs can use it to level the playing field and compete more effectively. The key is to start now. The longer you wait, the more you fall behind. Begin with one strategy, see the benefits, and then add more. The future of sales is here, and AI powers it.

Notably, image generation, computer vision, and recommendation systems. 2023 provided some incredible demos for these emerging technologies. But, it was just the first inning for AI in the workforce. 2024 is poised to be a big step forward in production-ready applications, efficiency-unlocking integrations for businesses, and a new paradigm for how humans work. This article will explore how innovative companies use custom AI chatbots to increase efficiency. Replacing the work done by humans with Artificial Intelligence has long been a theme in sci-fi. Today, it\u2019s the core focus of every Fortune 500 R&D team. The key differentiator between the sci-fi predictions and today is AI was thought to replace redundant blue-collar work first, and knowledge work last. Instead, the cost of knowledge is being driven to zero, with physical labor jobs in a shortage. With the breakthrough of language and diffusion models, text and image generation has become basically automated. While image creation is more nuanced, text is required in every single business on the planet. If you or someone who works for you is writing redundant text, you are not operating at optimal efficiency, speed, and margins thanks to advancements by leading AI solution companies. Many companies are fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and experimenting with LLMs. The potential gains from properly implementing these models is massive. But these gains do not all require custom code. You can start by simply combining tools and defining workflows. is using internally is x a template x . Here is how it works. Fireflies AI joins all of our Google Meets and records a transcription of everything said and who said it, this is the main way our company communicates, and we use it for hiring, prospecting, contract negotiation, and our project update meetings. We download the transcript from Fireflies AI and drag and drop it into the Claude chatbot. Go to Google Drive and select a template we have created, this includes a weekly update email template, proposal template, contract template, and more. The items in these documents that change are displayed in brackets, like [date] or [estimated length of project]. We then copy and Paste the template into Claude With both a transcript and a template in the context window for Claude, Prompt it the direction, i.e \u201cfill in the proposal template based on the conversation we held with the client.\u201d As long as the key points were mentioned in the transcript, 9-10 bracketed variables are filled in, with nuanced, detailed variables pulled from the call. This process saves our company a few hours a week, and also improves our operating margins as we don\u2019t need to hire someone to do it \u2013 we just rely on two robots! We are currently building out the software to automate this process, and are imagining many other automations that could help our agency run on autopilot while improving the quality of our work! With LLMs, the most popular use case has been using a chatbot, similar to the likes of chatGPT, but with a company\u2019s internal knowledge base to query answers from, leveraging an advanced AI system.. This technique is called Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG for short. The technique uses the best of both worlds from AI and searches, using data to ensure accuracy while using the LLM to generate the most relevant responses in real-time. The clearest example of this done successfully is Klarna, wrote about Klarna\u2019s $40 million value add . In summary, Klarna\u2019s mundane task of answering user questions is now automated with chatbots, and the chatbots are performing even better than humans were \u2013 reducing repeat inquiries by 25% and slashing the average query resolution time from 11 minutes to just 2. Other repetitive tasks are being automated by LLMs, including content generation, email management, translation, summarization, code generation, and more. Much of the value is finding itself accruing to the big technology companies. Subtle changes are appearing in Google Suite, Microsoft Teams, and Adobe Acrobat (i.e. Adobe aims to help SMBs realize these same unlocks, and ride the waves of this new paradigm. A recommendation system has become a requirement for any company that has a consumer-facing platform. The clearest example of how valuable a recommendation system can be is looking at TikTok. The entire basis of the company is figuring out a custom AI algorithm to hook in users. While this strong algorithm, especially for goofy dance videos, is questionable ethically, it is without a doubt the way the world is heading. The recommendation system has become the staple of value for social media companies Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) as well. Tik Tok\u2019s Recommendation Algorithm But it\u2019s not just social media platforms taking advantage of this. Any company that wishes to provide a personalized user experience is optimizing self-improving algorithms. From scheduling a trip to matching with a co-founder, taking user data, and interpreting it with AI to provide an improved experience and faster time to the desired outcome is an incredible business advantage. Recommendation systems can also be used internally. From job matching to route matching, AI use cases like these make huge differences in company efficiency. Companies interacting with the real world often rely on human vision, recording, and analysis. We are now living in a dystopian world where that is no longer required. Computers can reason based on the pixels they take in, understand what is happening, predict what will happen next, and take action to best operate under the circumstances. Take self-driving cars as an example. Other use cases like medical image analysis, traffic monitoring, sports analysis, or analyzing visual data on a computer screen i.e. stock charts, user interfaces, etc. can be impacted. The general advice for how companies should think about integrating AI, is to start with a hacky system around pre-built tools. Much like how is downloading transcripts from Fireflies AI and plugging it into the context window of Claude with a template, you can find creative systems to get more efficient. Once you\u2019ve found a way to be more efficient, automate the process. Use API\u2019s, Retool, prompt engineering, and other simple tactics to take it one step past your hacky setup. If you are building customer facing i.e a chatbot this can work too. As you build out proof of concepts, aim to prompt engineer into product market fit, and later fine-tune for scale."

The integration of Generative AI into education will not only change how educational content is delivered but also enriches the learning experience. The goal is to create a more interactive, personalized, and accessible learning experience through natural language processing AI. There are two paths in which Generative AI can be used to build tools for education. These paths are to build tools that harness Natural Language Processing or Adaptive Learning Algorithms. Below are just some of the potential tools that can be built using these technologies. Natural Language Processing (NLP) NLP can analyze students\u2019 written responses or interactions to provide personalized feedback, enabling tailored support that addresses individual learning needs. It allows for the automated grading of open-ended responses and essays, significantly reducing teachers\u2019 workload and providing instant feedback to students. NLP is instrumental in language learning applications, where it aids in pronunciation correction, grammar suggestions, and conversational practice with AI-driven bots. It can transform text into speech or vice versa, assisting students with disabilities by making content more accessible. Adaptive algorithms create customized learning paths for students, ensuring that learners are neither bored with too-easy material nor overwhelmed by content that\u2019s too challenging. They provide immediate feedback and recommendations, helping students understand their mistakes and learn at a pace suited to their needs. By keeping the content challenging yet achievable, adaptive learning helps maintain student engagement and motivation. These algorithms generate valuable data on student learning patterns, which educators can use to improve instruction and support. Ethics of Using Generative AI In Education The largest hurdle that Generative AI is going to face in education is gaining the trust of parents, teachers, and students. Therefore, transparency and accountability are going to be paramount. It is crucial that everyone is on the same page and understands the rationale behind the decisions that Generative AI makes. This touches on the notion that parents and students must be able to give informed consent when engaging with educational tools built using Generative AI. Additionally, addressing bias and fairness is necessary. Efforts must be made to mitigate algorithmic bias by using diverse datasets. Other concerns include data privacy. Presumably, education platforms that use Generative AI are going to need to collect information on students to provide the best service possible. However, this means leaving students vulnerable if their information is lost or stolen. Thus, legal frameworks will need to adapt swiftly to ensure that sensitive student information is protected. Before these tools can be deployed on a wide scale, we will need to investigate their impacts on learning and development. Understanding any potential unintended consequences of these tools will lead to better outcomes for students in the long run. These risk factors are non trivial and must be taken into consideration when developing new tools. While these tools may help to boost students\u2019 grades, maintaining human interaction to foster soft skills and personal development is also essential. It\u2019s crucial to balance the drive for efficiency with the preservation of human elements that contribute to critical thinking, creativity, and the development of new ideas. Generative AI has the potential to significantly transform the educational landscape by improving the learning experience for students.

Through a licensing agreement, Klarna was able to customize the fine-tuning of OpenAI\u2019s GPT models to build their AI Assistant. Given the advantages that of AI are expected to experience, it will be no surprise if we see this partnership continue to grow in the future. 2023 was the year that showed us the capabilities of AI, but 2024 will show us the true value it can create. While they are one of the first companies to announce the deployment of internal automation through AI, they are not going to be the last. Using A Workforce Augmentation Strategy Anyone who can fully automate tasks using AI is going to see large productivity gains that lead to increased profits. However, given the extremely high costs of developing proprietary AI tools, not everyone is going to be able to benefit from AI the way Klarna has, often with the help of specialized AI agencies. By focusing on the most important questions and building tools that address specific pain points, companies can augment their current workforce with AI capabilities. On top of this, the percentage of tasks that AI can augment is five to six times larger than those that can be automated. With a bigger audience, tools that augment labor are going to be able to have a much wider influence. When developing new tools that augment labor, AI should be leveraged to handle routine, repetitive tasks and queries. Instead of replacing all of your customer service representatives, let AI handle routine customer interactions that are easy to resolve. This in turn will free up your customer service representatives to focus on high-value customers with more complex issues. The benefits of humans working alongside AI are plentiful. Employees are likely to experience upskilling and current talent will be able to move upward within companies. This is essential because having and keeping the right talent to work alongside these technologies will What Can We Build Using This Strategy? Focusing on building augmentations instead of full automations, companies can leverage AI to enhance productivity and efficiency. This is especially true in areas that have already benefited from other forms of technological change.

What Can We Build With Claude 3? What Do Skeptics Say? On March 4th, 2024, Anthropic the release of its newest and most powerful LLM yet, Claude 3. This new model accepts multimodal inputs such as text, image, entire documents, and more. Through investments totaling 4 billion dollars from Amazon and the success of claude AI previous models, Claude 2 and Claude 2.1, Anthropic has already proven it can compete directly with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini 1.0 models. Claude 3 pushes the barriers of what they have previously built. With a context window of 200k tokens, Claude 3 could read a book and summarize it, or write an entire screenplay twice as fast as before. Anthropic plans to offer three different models to consumers: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. All of these new models will be available to both developers and consumers through Anthropics APIs or the Claude Pro subscription at various price points. Opus is the most powerful of the three models being made available. Anthropic claims that Opus outperforms GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra in undergraduate knowledge, graduate reasoning, grade school math, and knowledge Q&A. The second most powerful model is Sonnet, which offers a lower cost option than Opus. Haiku has yet to be fully released to the public but Anthropic claims it will be The various models are designed for different audiences and have been tuned for various products and services that Anthropic anticipates Claude 3 will be used for. Anthropic suggests that Opus be used for task automation and R&D while the smaller Sonnet could be used for product recommendation and data processing. Once Haiku is released, we could see it being used for content moderation. What Sets Claude 3 Apart From Its Predecessors? Compared to previous generations of LLMs, Claude 3 has a much larger context window of 200k tokens. Anthropic has announced on its website that for select users this limit can be extended to 1 million tokens. A larger context window will allow anyone to build new tools and applications that create more for customers. Let\u2019s look at the case of R&D and how they can benefit from a larger context window. Claude 3 is said to be able to read a 10k token paper from arXiv with charts and graphs in under 3 seconds. This is significantly faster than Claude 2 and other previous generations of LLMs, giving researchers the ability to keep up with new publications as soon as they are released. What sets Claude 3 apart from its predecessors is its multimodal capabilities. Being able to process various forms of unstructured data simultaneously allows Claude 3 to analyze a series of technical graphs, understand different trends, and create more detailed reports. In a recent interview with , Anthropic\u2019s co-founder Daniela Amodei claimed that Claude 3 had a better understanding of risk than its predecessors. With a more nuanced understanding of risk, Claude 3 could be poised to give better responses when asked about sensitive topics. With Claude 2, sensitive topics would sometimes seem to trigger the models content moderation settings, leading to What Can We Build With Claude 3? Claude 3 is much more versatile and powerful than its predecessors. This will allow companies across various industries to realize the value of Claude 3 and build new LLM-based applications. Anyone can deploy Claude 3 to automate customer support services, handling inquiries, resolving issues, and providing personalized assistance round-the-clock. Claude 3 could help insurance companies to streamline their operations by automatically processing claims, reducing overhead costs by analyzing personal data, and improving the productivity of their employees. Marketers can use Claude 3 in the ideation and copywriting process to help augment their content. This can be done to save time or to create more engaging and personalized content for readers. Social media platforms could deploy Claude 3 to analyze content and filter out inappropriate posts in real time. How Does Claude 3 Address Ethical Concerns? Anthropic claims that Claude 3 is built using their policies. This includes using supervised and reinforced learning to help train each model that they release. The goal of Anthropic\u2019s Constitutional AI policy is to train their models to respond to harmful or otherwise nefarious questions by explaining why it will not respond. Additionally, when compared to previous models, Claude 3 demonstrates a lower bias score. This bias score is calculated using the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering test, which is a standard benchmark used to evaluate LLMs. What Do Skeptics Say? Anthropic has claimed impressive performance on several types of tests that indicate that the Claude 3 Opus model outperforms all competitors in text-based tasks. These results have not been verified by any outside source so we have to take these results at face value. In my opinion, the best way to verify these results and show us the capabilities of Claude 3 would be to have an unbiased third party rerun the evaluation. Gemini Pro was trained to accept up to tokens. This makes Claude 3\u2019s context window seem small in comparison and begs the question of whether Anthropic will be able to keep up with competition in the future. There is also the argument that given the closed-source nature of Claude 3, it is more difficult for developers to build new customized products and services because they do not have access to the original weights. Thus, close-sourced models are likely to underperform compared to open-source models in specific use cases. Out of the big three, it is difficult to say who has the upper hand. Google\u2019s larger context window will allow it to attract more customers in the future while OpenAI\u2019s brand recognition will allow GPT-4 to maintain its market share. One thing is for sure, with its new Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku models being released, Anthropic is going to continue to be competitive with OpenAI and Google. Therefore it begs the question, do you switch to Claude 3 if you are already using GPT-4 or Gemini? After having used Claude 3 and comparing it to GPT-4 and Gemini, its answers feel more natural. On top of this, Anthropics\u2019 approach to development is more sustainable than their competition because of their Constitutional AI guidelines. Given that all three products have similar price offerings, switching is going to be a matter of long term strategic partnerships and whether the benefits gained outweigh the cost of changing service providers.

        "content": "Edge AI: Intelligence in Every Device | Linkt Enhance insights with image and video analysis Tailor experiences with personalized suggestions Streamline creativity with text prompts Enhance insights with image and video analysis Tailor experiences with personalized suggestions Streamline creativity with text prompts Edge AI: Intelligence in Every Device How does Edge AI Work? What Are The Advantages of Edge AI? How can Edge AI be Harnessed? The world is still coming to terms with how Gen AI and are going to be drivers for economic growth. Yet, there is already a new technology on the way that is going to represent an even bigger shift in the products we see and will reshape how we interact with AI daily. Edge AI is a term that few have heard about. This type of AI falls under the umbrella of embedded systems where software runs \u201con the edge\u201d. Edge AI models will be able to run directly on smartphones, hospital monitors, and industrial equipment allowing for rapid decision-making. With real-time processing at or near the data source, AI is only going to become more impactful. How does Edge AI Work? Edge AI operates on the idea of processing data \u201con the edge\u201d, meaning that the inference step is performed on the device. This contrasts with the typical Cloud AI that we have become familiar with, where data is shipped from a device to a centralized server for processing. By shifting this processing closer to the data source, Edge AI can reduce the reliance on communication between devices and servers, leveraging advanced AI intelligence. Edge AI models are optimized to operate on the devices that they will be deployed to. This means that during the development phase, engineers must decide how to train each model so that it can be deployed without performance slipping. The major drawback of deploying Edge AI is that edge devices do not have the same computing and storage capabilities as does Cloud AI technology. This means that engineers must either reduce or compress the model weights. What Are The Advantages of Edge AI? One of the biggest advantages of Edge AI is its ability to enable real-time processing. Think about a self-driving car, the amount of time that it takes to send data to a server, have the server process that data, and return an instruction to the car can be upwards of 250ms. While a quarter of a second may not seem like much, it can be essential in stopping accidents. Compare this to the almost instantaneous processing that could happen if there was no need to send the data to the server and it becomes obvious that Edge AI is a technology of the future. Another key advantage of Edge AI lies in its scalability. By reducing the strain on centralized servers by running inference tasks on edge devices, applications can scale to larger audiences. In particular, moving AI to the edge opens up entirely new possibilities where even without internet access, anyone can have access. Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of Edge AI for businesses is its potential to significantly reduce costs. By minimizing the need for data transfers between edge devices and centralized servers, businesses can cut down on bandwidth usage and its associated costs. On top of this, maintaining communication infrastructure is notoriously expensive. By shifting the focus of engineers away from maintenance to developing new products and services, businesses can build even more value. Edge AI is also going to heavily influence the cybersecurity industry by improving data security. Keeping data localized and reducing the need to transmit data, Edge AI mitigates many of the risks associated with data breaches. This is particularly true for businesses that must store personally identifiable information (PII) and must comply with a long list of regulations. How can Edge AI be Harnessed? One of the many promising areas for applications of Edge AI is IoT and smart devices. By embedding AI capabilities directly into connected devices, businesses can offer more intelligent and responsive products to their customers. Imagine a more powerful smartwatch that could analyze your biometric data and help you plan your meals for the week or an app on your phone that can take a picture of your garden and tell you when to water your plants. Edge AI is going to help transform the automotive industry. By leveraging its real-time decision-making capabilities, widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles may no longer be so far away. In the healthcare sector, Edge AI has the potential to revolutionize how we imagine patient care. By deploying AI models to edge devices, healthcare providers can deliver more personalized treatments, improved diagnostics, and timely intervention to improve patient outcomes. For instance, imagine a busy emergency room with dozens of patients waiting to be seen. Edge devices with AI capabilities could be used in this scenario to asynchronously monitor patients while they wait. If there are any early warning signs that a patient\u2019s health is deteriorating, the edge device can alert hospital staff immediately and prompt them to take preventative action. Beyond these key use cases, the applications of Edge AI are virtually limitless. From manufacturing to logistics and retail to finance, few businesses won\u2019t be able to benefit from Edge AI. Edge AI is going to be a big driver of change that will reshape how we interact with technology daily. AI will truly be at our fingertips. Products and services that incorporate Edge AI are likely going to see rapid growth in the coming years. This growth is going to be powered by increasing investments in development and CPUs becoming more powerful over time. Any business that adopts Edge AI strategically stands to gain a competitive edge by improving the customer experience. How does Edge AI Work? What Are The Advantages of Edge AI?

Background on AI in Business Startups: The Agile Innovators Incumbents: The Resourceful Titans predicting the market for AI products and services to grow to over one trillion USD by 2030, there are going to be many opportunities to harness this economic shift. Not only does this projection underscore the technological change currently underway but also shows the potential of AI to redefine how businesses operate. There is no doubt that AI is here to stay; the big question now is who will be the winners of the AI race. Will it be the AI startups known for their ability to stay agile and innovate? Or will it be the incumbents who have the resources to build more powerful models? Background on AI in Business While the Large Language Models (LLM) product, ChatGPT, initiated the current hype cycle, the entire AI field is going through a golden period of funding, innovation, and utility. Here is a quick breakdown to put the different areas of AI into perspective: Machine Learning (ML): From predictive analytics to fraud prevention, ML is powering a wide range of applications. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Applications include chatbots, sentiment analysis, and language translation, fundamentally transforming customer service, content analysis, and communication. Large Language Models (LLMs): The largest form of AI models that are capable of generating original content with a text prompt, use in applications like Chatbots, Automated workflows, and Content Generation. Computer Vision: From facial recognition to object detection, computer vision algorithms are driving innovations in healthcare, retail, and surveillance. Deep Learning: With its ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data, deep learning fuels breakthroughs in image and speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, and drug discovery. Reinforcement Learning: This technology underpins advancements in robotics, gaming, and recommendation systems, offering new avenues for adaptive decision-making. Startups: The Agile Innovators Startups are well-positioned to benefit from AI\u2019s potential. With small teams comes quick decision making, granting the ability to challenge the large corporations slow, methodical, and calculated advancements. Consider the cases of Midjourney and Stability AI, whose generative image models from leading computer vision companies compete in quality and price with OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E. Both have shown us firsthand that they can be technological leaders in an industry crowded with large companies. Now take Google and their search engine as another example. With LLMs becoming more powerful, Google could soon launch an answer-based search product for all of its users. However, this would risk cannibalizing large parts of their blue links business that brings in billions of dollars in revenue for them each year. Thus counterintuitively, AI development companies and startups hold the upper hand when it comes to launching new and innovative products. Another way startups have set themselves apart from incumbents is their flexibility to harness open-source solutions. Using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, startups can pivot between different cutting-edge models. They can take risks and quickly iterate while benefiting from collaborating with the global AI community. This democratization has proven that collaboration can be the antithesis of the red tape that makes incumbents notoriously slow to innovate. Ability to take risk Incumbents: The Resourceful Titans When it comes to AI development, the biggest hurdle is the huge costs associated with training new models. This is where AI tech companies have the greatest advantage in comparison to startups. The cost required to hire a team of top talent engineers, and the computational costs of training a new model can add up quickly. Most startups just don\u2019t have the 100 million dollars that it cost OpenAI to train GPT-4. Another aspect of development that drives up the cost is access to hardware, specifically GPUs. Recently, announced that it plans on spending billions to buy new Nvidia H100s GPUs. While this will undoubtedly place Meta as one of the leading generative AI companies in the near future, it makes it even harder for startups to keep up. Beyond their access to capital and market power, incumbents can attract top-tier talent globally. With opportunities ranging from entry-level positions for recent college graduates to senior roles suitable for individuals with 20+ years of industry experience, incumbents provide unparalleled career advancement that is hard to say no to. Incumbents also have a huge edge when it comes to AI due to their strong market position. In the past, incumbents have slowed down the development of startups and competitors by using their patent portfolios to create legal barriers to entry. One advantage of this is that it ensures that they can maintain their market share for longer. With their ever-growing number of AI patents, Microsoft and IBM are poised to do just this. As with any new technology, regulations are needed to help protect consumers and prevent anti-competitive behavior by incumbents. This time, big tech companies are the ones lobbying Congress to be the ones that help write those new regulations. If they are successful and change the rules of the game in their favor, who knows what that could mean for competition. As AI continues to evolve, startups will continue to pop up with innovations. Those who are the most successful will have carved out a niche by building targeted products for small to medium-sized audiences. Others will be acquired by the top generative AI companies who continue to pour tens of billions into the research and development of new models. Others will struggle and die. At the end of the day, it will be the incumbents that benefit the most from this new wave of technological change as they always have. We are already seeing this with the massive growth in the market cap of large tech companies in the past few months. Federal regulators may still overcome their current gridlock but given the speed of change in the industry and lobbying efforts, they will likely always be two steps behind. There are a small group of states that have begun taking it into their own hands to begin passing AI legislation. We can hope that it will provide a framework for nationwide intervention in the future, and an even playing field for startups and incumbents alike.
